Html Conventions with PageExtensions Recipe
==
FubuMVC allows not only a plethora of extension helper methods for building your views but also some nifty tricks to use conventions to standardise your view building.

I was reading an [excellent blog article](http://ntcoding.blogspot.com/2011/11/fun-with-fubus-html-conventions.html) from [@NTCoding](http://twitter.com/ntcoding) and realised it would make for an excellent recipe; with his permission I've taken his example and used it here along with some additional Javascript.

**NOTE!** The Javascript in this recipe has been 'knocked together' for the purposes of demonstrating Html Conventions, it's not meant to be exemplary.
